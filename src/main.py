"""
The  main  file for the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for our game.
It:
   1. Initializes pygame, the screen and a Clock (for the frame rate).
   2. Constructs a Game (model), View and Controller.
   3. Runs the game loop, which repeatedly (per the frame rate):
      -- Asks the Controller object to get and respond to events.
      -- Asks the Game object to run one cycle.
      -- Asks the View object to draw everything.
